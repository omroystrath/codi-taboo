This gives them a concrete clue about the material's durability without being too direct about what it is.\n\nThis hint builds on my previous clues about historical value and alchemical interest, while adding a scientific property that narrows down the possibilities significantly.

It's a well-known fairy tale that most people would recognize\n2. It directly involves the transformation of ordinary material (straw) into [SECRET]\n3.
